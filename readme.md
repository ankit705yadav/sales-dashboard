* **Secure Authentication:** Complete user login, signup, and session management powered by Clerk.
* **RESTful API:** A robust backend API built with NestJS to serve all dashboard data.
* **Database Integration:** Data is served from a PostgreSQL database, populated with a realistic seeding script for development.
* **Protected Routes:** Both frontend pages and backend API endpoints are protected, accessible only to authenticated users.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack & Architectural Choices
This project uses a modern, type-safe stack chosen for scalability, developer experience, and performance.

### Frontend
| Technology | Reason for Choice |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Next.js 14+ (App Router)** | Chosen for its powerful features like Server Components for performance, Client Components for interactivity, and a streamlined development workflow. |
| **Material-UI (MUI)** | A comprehensive component library that drastically speeds up UI development and ensures a consistent, professional look and feel. |
| **Recharts** | A simple and declarative charting library for React that makes it easy to create beautiful, dynamic data visualizations. |
| **Zustand** | Selected as a lightweight and minimal state management solution. It avoids the boilerplate of Redux while providing powerful state management for this project's scale. |
| **Clerk** | A complete user management platform that handles the complexities of authentication, session management, and user profiles, allowing for rapid and secure implementation. |

### Backend
| Technology | Reason for Choice |
| :--- | :--- |
| **NestJS** | A progressive Node.js framework built with TypeScript. Its modular and opinionated architecture (modules, controllers, services) enforces best practices, making the API highly scalable and maintainable. |
| **PostgreSQL** | A powerful and reliable open-source relational database, perfect for handling structured sales data. |
| **TypeORM** | A mature Object-Relational Mapper (ORM) that simplifies database interactions by allowing us to work with TypeScript classes and objects, ensuring type safety from the API down to the database. |

## ‚öôÔ∏è Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up the project on your local machine.

### Prerequisites
* Node.js (v18 or later)
* npm or yarn
* Git
* A running PostgreSQL instance (local or cloud-hosted)
* A Clerk account for API keys

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ankit705yadav/sales-dashboard
cd sales-dashboard
```

### 2. Backend Setup
1.  Navigate to the backend directory:
    ```bash
    cd backend
    ```
2.  Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
3.  Create an environment file by copying the example:
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```
4.  Fill in your `.env` file
5.  Populate the database with sample data:
    ```bash
    npm run seed #comment-out "ssl" from backend/src/app.module.ts when using local-DB
    ```
6.  Start the backend server:
    ```bash
    npm run start:dev
    ```
    The backend will be running at `http://localhost:3001`.
    API docs will be available at `http://localhost:3001/api-docs`.

### 3. Frontend Setup
1.  Open a **new terminal** and navigate to the frontend directory:
    ```bash
    cd frontend
    ```
2.  Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
3.  Create a local environment file by copying the example:
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```
4.  Fill in your `.env` file.
5.  Start the frontend server:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    The frontend will be running at `http://localhost:3000`.
